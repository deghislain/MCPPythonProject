I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a financial report for IBM at this moment as the function calls are not returning any data. This could be due to:

1. Technical issues with the data retrieval system
2. Temporary unavailability of the financial data
3. API connection issues

To provide you with an accurate and comprehensive financial report, we would need access to the actual financial data. Would you like to:

1. Try the request again in a few moments
2. Verify the stock symbol (though "IBM" is correct)
3. Consider using an alternative data source

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll be happy to help you get the financial information you need.
